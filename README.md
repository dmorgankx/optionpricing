# Sobol Sequence Generator

This repository contains kdb+/q code, translated from C++, which demonstrates how the C++ Sobol sequence library (SobolSeq16384) can be used in financial problems.

The `Financial Examples` notebook replicates the `main.cpp` C++ program which generates option prices for both Asian and European markets.

## Requirements

kdb+ ≥ 3.5 64-bit
Python ≥ 3.5.0 (macOS/Linux) ≥ 3.6.0 windows
SobolSeq16384 (available at [broda.co.uk](http://www.broda.co.uk/SobolSeq/SobolOptionPricing.ZIP))
